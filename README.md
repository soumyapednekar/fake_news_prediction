# Fake News Prediction System

This project focuses on building a Fake News Prediction System using Machine Learning with Python. We aim to develop a model that can accurately classify whether a given piece of news is fake or real. For this purpose, we will be using the Logistic Regression model for prediction.

## Overview

Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, impacting public opinion and undermining trust in media. Detecting fake news is crucial to maintain the integrity of information dissemination. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to create a predictive model capable of identifying fake news articles.

## Implementation

The entire project is implemented in Python programming language. We utilize libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

### Tools and Libraries Used:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn


## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset file from the provided link: [Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)
3. Place the dataset file (`train.csv`) in the same directory as your project files.
4. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

5. Open the main Python notebook (`Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb`) in your preferred Python environment.
6. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code and train the Logistic Regression model.
7. Once the model is trained, you can use it for prediction on new news articles.
